===

## Requirements
Create a function that accepts 2 presorted arrays of integers as it's input. Your function should merge these 2 arrays and return a final *single* sorted array.

**Note:** The length of either array does not matter.  All integers in the array will be whole numbers with a positive value. 

For example:
``` javascript
// given:
[2, 5, 13, 21]

// and:
[3, 19, 27, 31]

// return:
[2, 3, 5, 13, 19, 21, 27, 31]
```

## Submission Instructions

1. With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
1. Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
1. This folder should contain:
	- A file named `solution.js` which contains the JavaScript solution
	- A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
	- A `README.md` which includes the problem domain
1. Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional.
1. Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch.
1. Submit a link to your PR on Canvas or submit a link to your `repo/daily-whiteboarding-directory/solution.js`

## Stretch Goal

1. Included with your `solution.js`, create a `__test__` directory and associated `solution.test.js` file, that contains a series of tests for your solution.  You may write as many tests (and assertions) as you'd like.
